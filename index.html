                    My name is Jose L. Zapata. I am 33 years old. My country of birth is Peru. I left Peru and came to the United States when I was about 6 or 7 years old. Even before then, I had a passion for technology. Around that time, the Atari game consoles and the first Nintendo consoles were all the rage. I was immediately intriguied by technology.

                    As I grew older, I explored many aspects of technology. From a deep love of video games, to modifying computer operating systems and hardware. I figured out how to set up AOL over 56K when it first came out with the weekly or monthly free trials. I introduced my family and a lot of my peers to the internet for the first time. When I went to college, I initially wanted to major in Network engineering, because I had a lot of previous experience setting up and troubleshooting networks. One of the requirements for the Networking degree was talomg a couple of introductory classes to c++ objective programming. The first time I took the C++ plus, I went to the councelor and changed my major to computer programming and database programming. I instantly became hooked with programming, and have been ever since.
